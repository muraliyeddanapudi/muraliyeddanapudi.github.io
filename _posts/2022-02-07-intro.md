Welcome to my blog. I plan to use this site to record stuff that I am learning (from books, papers and most often exploring the internet ;) on topics at the intersection programming, applied math, and dynamic systems modeling and simulation. I hope that in addition to helping me archive what I learnt for easy future reference, the posts here will help others also exploring these topics.

Many thanks to [Gregory Gundersen](https://gregorygundersen.com/) for the [inspiration](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/01/12/why-research-blog/) to start this blog and also for sharing the details of how he built his [blog](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/06/21/blog-theme/).

Below are handy examples showing how to write equations, draw diagrams, insert code, in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/jekyll/). It is mostly here as a reference for me.

#### Math

Following the instructions in this [post](https://benlansdell.github.io/computing/mathjax/) I was able to nicely insert math equations, like the famous [Euler's identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_identity)

$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 \tag{1}
$

you can also have equations like $x = A\backslash b$ inlined into the text.

#### Code snippets

Inserting code snippets is a breeze

```
// Hello World in C++

#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

and it is *easy* to do basic **text** and `code` formatting.

#### Tables

[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/jekyll/) is a handy reference for quickly looking up how to write tables, etc.

| Syntax      | Description | Test Text     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| Header      | Title       | Here's this   |
| Paragraph   | Text        | And more      |

#### Images

It is easy to include images using markdown, however you cannot control the scale or alignment. it is best done using directly with HTML

<p align="center">

</p>

#### Diagrams

[Mermaid](https://github.com/jasonbellamy/jekyll-mermaid) is a Jekyll plugin for drawing diagrams using markdown. Here is my clunky attempt at drawing the classic feedback loop.
<div align=center class="mermaid">
graph LR
ref((r))
dum1(("-"))
ctlr(Controller)
plnt(Plant)
dum2(( ))
out((y))
ref-->dum1
dum1-->ctlr
ctlr-->plnt
plnt-->dum2
dum2-->dum1
dum2-->out
</div>

I found Section 2 on [this page](https://jojozhuang.github.io/tutorial/jekyll-diagram-with-mermaid/) quite helpful in setting it up.
