We often have signals that comprise of continuous segments with a finite number of discontinuities.

<div align="center">
$
y(t)=\begin{cases}
0 & t < 1 \\\\
t & 1 \leq t < 2 \\\\
1 & 2 \leq t < 3 \\\\
0 & 3 \leq t
\end{cases}
$
</div>
  
In software, we can represent such signals using repeated time values at the discontinuities. For example, $y(t)$ shown above can be concisely represented in MATLAB for $t\in[0,10]$ using the vectors:
```
t = [0 1 1 2 2 3 3 10]
y = [0 0 1 2 1 1 0  0]
```
While the above representation is simple and intuitive[^1], visualizing such signals requires additional processing. Simply plotting $t$ along the horizontal axis and $y$ along the vertical axis as shown below (in MATLAB) results in a solid line across the discontinuity, which does not indicate that the signal is discontinuous at that point.
```
plot(t, y), ylim([-1, 3])
```

I wrote a small utility [tsplot](https://github.com/muraliyeddanapudi/tsplot) (the repo also includes a python implementation) to plot such signals in a better manner by drawing a dotted line across the discontinuity and using a dot to indicate the signal value at the discontinuity.
```
tsplot(timeseries(y',t')), ylim([-1 3])
```

Plotting in this manner is particularly useful when the signal is a bit more complex and has lot more discontinuities as shown below.

[^1]: This idea also works with three repeated time points to represent the signal values at $T^-$, $T$ and $T^+$ if $y(T)$ is neither left nor right continuous at time $T$.
